      First of all, I would like to say that the video was excellent. Honestly, I watched the entire thing. I got sucked in my all the great questions, some of which I had myself. I feel like DBC will definitely be intense. I am both looking forward to it but at the same time not. On one hand, I'm excited to learn so much. So much so that it would prepare for a job. This is the greatest motivating factor for me to attend DBC. However, it makes me nervous that I will not keep up. However, through the chat, my nerves have been calmed a bit. To know that I am not alone in feeling like that. The fact that I felt earlier this week that I'm not keeping up. Much of my fears have been calmed just talking to folks on the Google+ group. I am not alone, but more importantly, I am not alone because my cohort and DBC staff will have my back!

      THe culture of DBC seems like a great fit for me. I naturally have a propensity for curiosity. I tend to take on challenges that I'm not too well equipped for. But the challenge of learning what I need to to get the job done always gets me going. I see myself being the person always saying I don't know to my teachers as well as my fellow cohort members. Also, I would be the one always asking how a certain thing is done if it helps me lessen my time on working on something. I am not too proud to ask for help. My general expectations of DBC have been solidified. This is what DBC sold me on in the first place. A place where I can freely learn by asking. Not just being spoon fed information. To me, memorizing is a poor way of learning. If i can engage through pairing and having the ability to converse about topics, I feel my learning will be much more accelerated.

      If I'm going to be completely honest, the only thing that I will struggle with is when it comes time for phase 1 and forward, I will miss spending time my son. If you can all help me by reminding me that I am also doing this for him, it would be a great help.
