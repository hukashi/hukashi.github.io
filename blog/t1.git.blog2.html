      What are the Benefits of Version Control?
    </p>
    <p>
      When a developer works on a project, it's always great to have a way of tracking your progress. Also it's great to have a way to fall back to something when the last bit of work you did causes things to break. Version Control offers a way for you to do this. This is not only important for developers working on solo projects but it's even more important for developers working as part of a team. This allows everyone to work on different aspects of a project and not step on each other's toes. This also protects the project, to a certain degree, from having slow downs due to code that just doesn't work and having to figure out where the problem occurred.

      How does git help you keep track of changes?
    </p>
    <p>
      Git is a local program that keeps track of changes you make to files. If you use the command "git status" it will alert you to any changes made to your working directory. From here you can choose to add changes to stage it for a commit with the command "git add ." The period at the end signals for all changed files to be staged. Then you can commit your changes to be ready to be pushed to a repository such as on Github.
    </p>
    <p>
        Why use Github to store your code?
    </p>
    <p>
      When working on a project where all the contributors are not always sitting next to you, it would great if there was one place to keep all the work. Along with git, you can use Github to collaborate with everyone on your team. Wen you do a push using git on your terminal, it sends the changes to the repository that everyone is sharing. Because Github can be accessed from anywhere with internet access, your team can be a part of the development from virtually anywhere!
