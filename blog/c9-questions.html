        <h4>How much information is enough information?</h4>
        <p>As human beings, it is natural that we ask questions. It's how we progress through life. Without these questions, we wouldn't be where we are. We had our slow beginnings and asked questions that were very broad which lead to new questions that were more specific. As the questions got more specific, we were able to answer these smaller, specific questions which in turn lead us to answer the larger questions.</p>
        <p>Questions should be posed in certain ways as to be efficient and certain that the person answering understands all the context as to be precise in their answer. Generally, for the most specific answers, Yes or No questions should be avoided. Questions with "who," "what," "where," "when," "how," or "why" lead to answers that have some thought and provide much more information. When asking the question, always try to provide as much context as possible. What actions lead to the problem? What environment is the problem ocurring. What have you tried thus far to solve the problem. What outcome are you looking for?</p>
        <p>I recently had an issue with my car. The check engine light(CEL) came on and I asked a friend who is a mechanic what the problem could be. In trying to resolve the problem on my own I was able to obtain the Diagnostic Trouble Codes(DTC) that caused the light to come on. Now, I could have asked my buddy "Why is my check engine light on?". I would have been met with a blank stare and/or since he is a good friend, a slap in the face. But instead, I asked him what could have caused the series of codes that caused the CEL to come on. Of course this is a much better question to ask but I could have gone even further. I could have told him the DTC's and then explained the series of events that took place just as the light appeared such as the engine shuddering or if the engine was already warmed up or it was from a cold start. Of course even with this information, my friend asked for even more to try and pinpoint the problem to offer insight. Eventually, he was able to figure out where the problem was ocurring with asking about a half dozen more questions about the car and it's history.</p>
        <p>Even if it seems tedious, this is the way to effectively ask questions to quickly find what you need. In the future, I hope to stay disciplined in asking good questions as to not waste my time or even someone else's time.</p>
