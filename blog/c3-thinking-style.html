        <p>I took my <a href="http://www.thelearningweb.net/personalthink.html">personal thinking quiz</a> and found out that I am mostly an Abstract Random thinker. Let's start by understanding what that means.</p>
        <h4>Abstract Random Thinkers tend to:</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>listen to others</li>
            <li>bring harmony to group situations</li>
            <li>establish healthy relationships with others</li>
            <li>focus on the issues at hand</li>
          </ul>
        <h4>We learn best when:</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>in a personalized environment</li>
            <li>given broad or general guidelines</li>
            <li>abel to maintain friendly relationships</li>
            <li>able to participate in group activities</li>
          </ul>
        <h4>What's hard for us?</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Having to explain or justify feelings</li>
            <li>Competition</li>
            <li>Working with dictatorial/authoritarian personalities</li>
            <li>Working in a restricitve environment</li>
            <li>Working with people who don’t seem friendly</li>
            <li>Concentrating on one thing at a time</li>
            <li>Giving exact details</li>
            <li>Accepting even positive criticism</li>
          </ul>
        <p>With most of these holding true, I think I can definitely gain from DBC by being a good listener as well as being able to bring harmony to group situations. DBC, being a very social place and using that as one of it's strengths to teach will be central to how I learn.</p>
        <p>So far, Phase 0 has been going very well. I definitely enjoyed working on the challenges thus far. I found it great to have people to reach out to if I needed help. This incuded my cohort mates as well as office hours. I struggled with finding answers to some of the challenges and I ultimately found myself going to other people to get the answers. I will definitely continue this way of learning as I know some struggle with reaching out for help.</p>
        <p>I will continue my path with a Growth Mindset. As <a href="http://www.brainpickings.org/index.php/2014/01/29/carol-dweck-mindset/">Carol Dweck</a> states: A “fixed mindset” assumes that our character, intelligence, and creative ability are static givens which we can’t change in any meaningful way, and success is the affirmation of that inherent intelligence, an assessment of how those givens measure up against an equally fixed standard; striving for success and avoiding failure at all costs become a way of maintaining the sense of being smart or skilled. A “growth mindset,” on the other hand, thrives on challenge and sees failure not as evidence of unintelligence but as a heartening springboard for growth and for stretching our existing abilities. I already see that my mindset is changing as I conquer each new week during phase 0. This is building my confidence that I indeed can learn new things and they do not have to already be naturally there. One way I can strengthen this is to look for other ways of learning something that I already understand. To be able to see it from different angles, so to speak. I believe this will help train my mind to absorb information in other ways that I don't seem to be doing so well now.</p>
