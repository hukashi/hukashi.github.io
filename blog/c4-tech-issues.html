        <h4>Women in Tech</h4>
        <p>I have read a few articles about the problems facing the Tech World. Did a few google searches and many articles popped up with problems that are tech related. For example, the amount of data our tech gathers over time from it's users. This data is useful but much of it is also useless. Other tech problems like the work enviornment. As more and more projects are created, the need for speed is rising. This leads to burnout and loss of employee assets that can cost companies more money in the long run. By reading more about these, they led me to a whole different set of articles. About how there is a lack of women in the industry and why that is.</p>
        <p>From working at large corporations in my past, it was always valued to diversify the employees in a company so that the best decisions can be made with a wide pool of suggestions. Every employee from very different backgrounds will offer insight into the business and make valuable contributions. It seems that a very large demographic is very poorly represented in tech. Woman are the ultimate minority here. What is strange is that the demographics of people who use tech very much cover quite a large number of woman. If the industry wants to target that audience, it would only make sense to have them in the development of these products to fine tune them to tailor it to them.</p>
        <p>Now why is there such a lack? Well, one thing is, girls at a young age aren't introduced into the tech world as a viable future for them. That is changing today however, and I believe we are headed in the right direction. The other very large problem is that the current tech industry is dominated by males and so making room for females is difficult. Also, the enviorment is very unfriendly to females. Reports of sexism show up now and then. This makes it difficult for women to enter this industry or even stay there once having entered.</p>
        <p>Hopefully, the tech industry grows and women find ways to get in to prove their worth to pave the way for more women. The presence of woman in this industry can only make it better. They bring a whole new mindset and ideas that men wouldn't think of otherwise.</p>
