        <p>Hello, my name is Jonathan Chung.</p>
        <p>I am a highly motivated individual that loves to take on challenges, especially the ones that require me to learn new technologies. I am excited to work on new projects as I want to create new things with exciting new technologies and frameworks.
        <p>As a recent Dev Bootcamp grad, I have been busy working on side projects as well as this page to advertise the skills that I have learned and am currently learning. Dev Bootcamp is an intense 19 week program where I not only learned to become a Fullstack Developer by using Ruby and Rails but learned how to learn. Dev Bootcamp teaches it's students that anything is achievable and equips them to go out and tackle anything and learn it as fast as possible. Javascript, jQuery, as well as some time with Angular followed during my time at Dev Bootcamp. I was able to implement some API's as well in some of the work I did there. You can see my final project if you click the link to my projects which is called "kidpanion".</p>
        <p>I have been in finance for most of my life and now would love to take on a new challenge. With my knowledge of Ruby and Rails, I believe I could achieve greater growth in not only using my knowledge of development but also the business acumen I have accumulated over the years. I have very strong communication, research, and analytical skills. Learning and building is my new passion that I am finally being able to realize.</p>
        <p>When I am not coding, I love playing with my son and teaching him how to do things. I hope to start teaching him the basics of coding soon! I love to play golf and cook.</p>
