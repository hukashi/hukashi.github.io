        <h2>Full Stack Web Developer</h2>
        <p>Hello, my name is Jonathan Chung.</p>
        <p>I am a highly motivated individual that loves to take on challenges, especially the ones that require me to learn new technologies. I am excited to work on new projects as I want to create new things with exciting new technologies and frameworks.
        <p>As a recent Dev Bootcamp grad, I have been busy working on side projects as well as this page to advertise the skills that I am currently learning. The bootcamp was an intense 19 week program where I not only learned to become a fullstack Developer by using Ruby and Rails. Javascript, jQuery, as well as some time with Angular followed during my time at Dev Bootcamp. I was able to implement some API's as well in some of the work I did there. You can see my final project if you click the link to my projects which is called "kidpanion".</p>
        <p>I have been in finance for most of my life and now would love to take on a new challenge. With my knowledge of Ruby and Rails, I believe I could achieve greater growth in not only using my knowledge of development but also the business acumen I have accumulated over the years. I have very strong communication, research, and analytical skills. Learning and building is my new passion that I am finally being able to realize.</p>
        <p>When I am not coding, I love playing with my son and teaching him how to do so many things. I love to play golf and cook.</p>
